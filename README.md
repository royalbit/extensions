# Zed Extensions

This is the central repository containing the extensions available for [Zed](https://zed.dev/).

## Getting started

See the [Developing Extensions](https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/developing-extensions) docs for how to develop and publish your extension

Looking for extension ideas? Check out:

- [Top theme requests](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atheme+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)
- [Top language requests](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alanguage+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)

If an issue requesting an extension is tagged with the `needs infrastructure` label, it indicates that the extension cannot currently be developed due to the absence of necessary system infrastructure.

## Contributing (AI-Only Development)

**Pull Requests are disabled on this fork.** This is intentional.

This fork uses the **Asimov Protocol AI-Only Development Model** ([ADR-011](https://github.com/royalbit/asimov-protocol/blob/main/docs/adr/011-ai-only-development-no-external-prs.md)).

External PRs are an **attack vector for ethics bypass**. The trust model is:

```
Human Owner → AI (autonomous) → Tests Pass → Direct Commit → Main
```
