# Contributing to Extensions

This project uses the **Asimov Protocol AI-Only Development Model** ([ADR-011](https://github.com/royalbit/asimov-protocol/blob/main/docs/adr/011-ai-only-development-no-external-prs.md)).

## How to Contribute

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Issues](https://github.com/royalbit/extensions/issues)** | Report bugs, request features |
| **Fork** | Create your own version |

## Why No Pull Requests?

This project is developed by an autonomous AI following the Asimov Protocol. External PRs are an attack vector that could bypass ethics safeguards.

**Trust Model:**
```
Human Owner -> AI (autonomous) -> Tests Pass -> Direct Commit -> Main
```
